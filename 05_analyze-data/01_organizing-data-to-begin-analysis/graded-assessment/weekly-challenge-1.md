### Question 1

In the data analysis process, which of the following refers to a phase of analysis? Select all that apply.

* Visualize the data
* **Organize data into understandable sections**
* **Get input from others**
* **Format data using sorts and filters**

> There are four phases of analysis: organize data, format and adjust data, get input from others, and transform data by observing relationships between data points and making calculations. 

&nbsp;

### Question 2

During which phase of analysis can you find a correlation between two variables?

* Format and adjust data
* Get input from others
* Organize data 
* **Transform data**

> Finding a correlation between two variables occurs while transforming data.

&nbsp;

### Question 3

You are performing a calculation during your analysis of a dataset. Which phase of analysis are you in? 

* **Transform data**
* Get input from others
* Organize data
* Format and adjust data

> You are the transform data phase of analysis. This is an example of identifying relationships and patterns between data.

&nbsp;

### Question 4

Typically, a data analyst uses filters when they want to expand the amount of data they are working with.

* True
* **False**

> Typically, a data analyst uses filters when they want to narrow down the amount of data they are working with. 

&nbsp;

### Question 5

A data analyst is sorting spreadsheet data. They want to make sure that, when they rearrange the data, data across rows is kept together. What technique should they use to sort the data?

* Sort Column
* **Sort Sheet**
* Sort Together
* Sort Rows

> Sort sheet sorts all of the data in a spreadsheet by a specific sorted column. Data across rows is kept together during the sort.

&nbsp;

### Question 6

A data analyst uses a function to sort a spreadsheet range between cells H1 and K65. They sort in ascending order by the first column, Column H. What is the syntax they are using? 

* **=SORT(H1:K65, 1, TRUE)**
* =SORT(H1:K65, A, FALSE)
* =SORT(H1:K65, A, TRUE)
* =SORT(H1:K65, 1, FALSE)

> The syntax is `=SORT(H1:K65, 1, TRUE)`. The first part of the function sorts the data in the specified range. The 1 represents the first column. And a TRUE statement sorts in ascending order.

&nbsp;

### Question 7

A data analyst is querying a database that contains data about dental equipment inventory. They are only interested in data related to cleaning products. Which of the following sections of an SQL statement would return the correct result?

* WHERE "Cleaning"
* **WHERE product = "Cleaning"**
* ORDER BY "Cleaning"
* ORDER BY product = "Cleaning"

> The correct section is `WHERE Product = "Cleaning"`. A WHERE statement in SQL includes the name of the column, an equals sign, and the value(s) in the column to include.

&nbsp;

### Question 8

A data analyst would write the following section of a SQL query to sort Golden Retrievers, ordered by birth date, in ascending order: 

```
WHERE Breed = "Golden Retriever" ORDER BY Birth_date
```

* **True**
* False

> The query will return Golden Retrievers, ordered by birth date, in ascending order.
